Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is PJ Graham. I'm an aspring Product Designer and Web Developer.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm eager to learn more about product design by helping with wireframes, prototyping and UX research with other developers and their design process. I find it interesting studying human interactions with products and what makes us want to click, so it's all fun (and hard work) to develop impactful websites. Also, I'm a great, optimistic team player and reliable to complete work.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with more technical aspects of product development. I'm interested in learning more about React, Node,js and Python! Which program would be the best transition from front-end development programs? I'd love help with understanding Javascript in more advance and broaden my coding skills.
