Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is PJ Graham. I'm an aspring Product Designer and Web Developer. When I was in high school, I was a nerd and loved spending hours on my computer designing the yearbook and newspaper publications. I directed the theme of the yearbook and spent my senior year creating templates and layouts that were conhesive. I lead a class of my peers to brainstorm ideas for features and delegated tasks with a helping hand. It was my first experience in a design role where I felt seen, heard and fully involved. 
  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a case study of conducting user research to advance UX capablities for Marriott Bonvoy Homestay website with Public Sapient consulting firm. I'm excited to complete this project because the goal is to make searching for a home stay easier for the user, and it has challenged my UX/UI design skills of incorporing interviews and survey results and use design to enhance the experience. ðŸ”­

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently enrolled in the Global Career Accelerator where we gain experience in HTML/CSS and Javascript, but we focus on preparing ourselves for a career in the tech industry. Meanwhile, I attend ASU online as a Graphic Information Technology (User Experience) major. I'm beginning my journey in product and UX design and have only created websites with HTML/CSS prior to enrolling in ASU. ðŸŒ±

  
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm eager to learn more about product design by helping with wireframes, prototyping and UX research with other developers and their design process. I find it interesting studying human interactions with products and what makes us want to click, so it's all fun (and hard work) to develop impactful websites. Also, I'm a great, optimistic team player and reliable to complete work.

  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with more technical aspects of product development. I'm interested in learning more about React, Node,js and Python! Which program would be the best transition from front-end development programs? I'd love help with understanding Javascript in more advance and broaden my coding skills.
