Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is PJ Graham. I'm an aspring Product Designer and Web Developer! You're probably asking yourself, why would you want to do that? When I was in high school, I was a nerd and loved spending hours working on the yearbook and newspaper publication. I directed the theme of the yearbook and spent my senior year creating templates and layouts that were conhesive. I lead a class of my peers to brainstorm ideas for features and delegated tasks with a helping hand. It was my first experience in a design role where I felt seen, heard and fully involved. 
  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a case study of using user research to advance UX capablities for Marriott Bonvoy Homestay website with Public Sapient consulting firm. I'm excited to complete this project because the goal is make searching for a home stay easier for the user, and it has challenged my UX research skills of incorporing interviews and surveys to enhance the experience. ðŸ”­

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently enrolled in Global Career Accelerator where we gain experience in HTML/CSS and Javascript, but we focus on preparing ourselves for a career in the tech industry. Meanwhile, I attend ASU online as a Graphic Information Technology (User Experience) major. I'm beginning my journey in product and UX design and have only created websites with HTML/CSS prior to enrolling in ASU. ðŸŒ±

  
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm eager to learn more about product design by helping with wireframes, prototyping and UX research with other developers. I find it interesting studying human interaction with products and what makes us click, so it's all fun (and hard work) to develop impactful websites. Also, I'm a great, optimistic team player and reliable to complete work.

  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with more technical aspects of product development. I'm interested in learning more about React, Node,js and Python! Which program would be the best transition from front-end development programs? I'd love help with understanding Javascript in more advance and broaden my coding skills.
