Welcome! 👋

My name is PJ Graham. I'm an aspring Front-End Developer with a focus in UX/UI Design and Research. 
  
- 👯 I care about people. That's why I want to use my research, technical and creative skills to develop new systems to increase usability in websites and mobile apps. 

- We are living in a virtual world with emerging technology changing our livelihood rapidly. As a Front-End Developer, I want to design interactive virtual spaces for users to feel comfort in the intimating world of the internet. 

- I'm currently pursuing an engineering Bachelor of Applied Science in Graphic Information Technology (User Experience) at Arizona State University. I am developing technical skills in Git, GitHub, front-end development and user experience design and research. Take a look at my projects on my page for coursework!

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with more technical aspects of web development. I'm currently enrolled in Meta's Front-End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera (check out my profile below)
